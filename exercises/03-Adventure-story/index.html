            The gravel of the gas station disappears as you dive into 
            the dense brush. You are alone in the wilderness with 
            no food, no water, and no phone. Behind you, the heavy,
            rhythmic thud of paws tells you the truth: the bear has
            caught your scent and is actively hunting you.

                The terrain is uneven, and the canopy blocks out the moonlight. 
                You need to make a move before the predator closes the gap.
