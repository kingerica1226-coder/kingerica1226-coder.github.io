            The bear has lost your immediate trail,
            but now the elements are your enemy. 
            You are exhausted and dehydrated.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are soaking wet. Hypothermia is setting in. You must decide:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <i>Build a Fire</i><br>
                <a href="fire.html">
                    <img src="images/fire.jpg" alt="fire" width="300">
                </a>
                <p> 
                    It will keep you warm but might draw the bear (or rescuers) 
                    to your exact spot.
                </p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>
                <i>Keep Moving</i><br>

                <p>  
                    Stay active to keep your blood flowing until 
                    you find a road or shelter, but you risk collapsing
                    from exhaustion.
