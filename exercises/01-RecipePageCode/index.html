        <h4> BREAKFAST </h4>
        <h1> BANANA BREAD PANCAKES</h1>
        <p> 
            Fluffy, cozy, and full of banana bread flavor, 
            these pancakes are the perfect weekend treat.
            <br> 
            The edges get golden and buttery
            while the centers stay soft and full of melty chocolate chips.
            <br>
            Stack them high, drizzle with maple syrup,
            and watch them disappear in seconds.

                <li>
                    In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas until mostly smooth
                    with a few small chunks left.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> 
                    Whisk in the egg, melted butter, vanilla extract,
                    and buttermilk until combined.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> 
                    In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar,
                    baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and use a rubber 
                    spatula to gently fold until just combined.
                    <br>
                    Don’t overmix — a few lumps in the batter are perfect.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> 
                    Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat and add 
                    about 1/2 tablespoon of butter to melt. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> 
                    Scoop about 1/2 cup of batter for each pancake,
                    or more depending on how big or small you like them. 
                    <br>
                    Once the batter hits the pan, sprinkle a few walnuts and 
                    mini chocolate chips right on top before flipping.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> 
                    Cook until bubbles form on top and edges look set, 
                    then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> 
                    Transfer to a plate and keep warm, then repeat
                    with the remaining batter, adding more butter 
                    to the pan as needed.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li> 
                    Serve warm with butter, maple syrup,
                    and an extra sprinkle of chocolate chips.
                </li>
